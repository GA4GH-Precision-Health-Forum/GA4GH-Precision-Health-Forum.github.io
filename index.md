# GA4GH Precision Health Forum
The GA4GH Precision Health Forum consists of regional precision health initiatives that are GA4GH Driver Projects and other Organizational Members. By coming together as a formal group, we strive to empower knowledge exchange and collaboration among global initiatives as they pursue the common goal of advancing human health.  
This consortium helps avoid both duplication of efforts across multiple countries as well as the collection of incompatible clinical genomic data and health information. A lack of global cooperation in data sharing and clinical implementation of genomics could mean inaccurate data interpretation, misdiagnosis and high cost solutions to healthcare.
## This community aims to:
* Contribute to the development and adoption of international GA4GH standards
* Enable collective learning by sharing best practices, challenges and opportunities with a technical, regulatory, clinical, and educational focus
* Identify areas of collaboration and resource/expertise sharing
* Develop pilot projects for global data sharing using large scale cohorts
* Identify common needs for standards across National Initiatives
 
## GA4GH Precision Health Toolkit 
The GA4GH Precision Health Forum has compiled a series of resources for partners in the community to facilitate sharing experience across different precision health initiatives.
